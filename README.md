# Object-Detection
This is an object detection model created to detect insulator objects in an image.
this is a project for someone and I was listed to assist. Really grateful for the opportunity 
to know how so much and help me expand my horizon on python.
There are a lot more files I'll be attaching here that aids the process such as creation of records file and the conversion from xml to csv files
